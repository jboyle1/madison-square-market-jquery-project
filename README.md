## Madison Square Market (jQuery Project)

### Description

I decided to complete this Codecademy jQuery project in my code editor rather than the online portal to get a more holistic understanding of the file and DOM linkage. I used the supplied source code and completed the steps using Github version control to commit documentation. Here is the project description:

Madison Square Market wants to use jQuery to make drop-down menus appear and disappear on its home page.

The steps below outline how to write jQuery code that provides the following interactivity:

* A menu appears when a user clicks on a specific menu header
* The menu disappears when the userâ€™s mouse exits the menu.
